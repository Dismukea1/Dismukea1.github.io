    <p> When you view a web page in your browser, you are seeing the interpreted code that you type into you text editor. Web pages are made up of text which is called "Marked Up", or formatted using Hyper Text MarkUp language or HTML. The HTML codes, known as tags, are placed around the text that you want to format. In most cases, where formating should start and where it should end.</p>
    
    <p>Content on an web page is containd inside elements. There are basically two types of elements, block ans inline. This contenet is being written inside a paragraph element, which is a block element because there will be a space above and below the paragraph essentially blocking it off from other conten. <strong> however this content is in strong element which is inline. Inline elements do not separate their content</strong>. Block elemenets will effect a pages layout, where inline elements will not.</p>
    
    <p>There are all diffrent types of elements that go to make up a web page. The element used on this page is the HTML, which is also called the root element, the head element, body element, headign element, paragraph element, and strong element.
